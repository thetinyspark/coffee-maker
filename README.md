# Coffee maker, a tiny MVC oriented lib

This lib is inspired by PureMVC framework. 
I just did some modifications and added a IoC Container. 

The available pattern in this lib are: 

- Command (controller)
- Model 
- Proxy
- Mediator
- Facade 
- IoC Container

If you're comfortable with those patterns, it should be easy to use. 
If not, then more documentation will comme very soon cause this package 
is designed to be merged with @thetinyspark/moocaccino-barista.
